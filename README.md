- The app should have the following file structure (for the src folder): 
  - src 
    - styles.css (imported only in PostsList.js) 
    - PostsList.js 
    - Post.js 
    - Comment.js
- Once running, it should display a single page with a couple of posts in it. 
- Each post should display its title, the post’s author, the number of total likes, and its comments (each individual comment on a new row) – refer to the example below. 
- You should design your own UI, a sample one is provided below. 
- Use stateful/stateless components wisely. 
- Here is the sample data for the state object of the PostsList component.
